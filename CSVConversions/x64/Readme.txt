as of this moment Rewards and Inventory Items are not supported due to rec room referencing them by obfuscated strings
might work on this in the future but likely not.

supported types are int, float, bool, string and color.

open example xlmx file to see how to format your sheet.

To convert, save your file as "CSV UTF-8(comma delimited)" type.

The file name should be "DataSheet.csv". 

You can change the filename the tool scans for by editing the "Filename.txt" file.

Converted output is saved to "data.txt"
